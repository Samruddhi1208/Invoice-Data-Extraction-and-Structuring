**Invoice Data Extraction and Structuring**

The system extracts key information such as Invoice Number, Date, Seller, Tax ID, and Item details from large number of invoice images.
Using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the system reads text from invoice images and processes it into a structured JSON format. The frontend interface, built using Streamlit, allows users to upload invoice images and instantly view the extracted data. This automation minimizes manual effort and errors in data entry, significantly improving operational efficiency in financial document processing.
